## Overview

This is an responsive webpage that calculates you age when you type in birthdate!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

Desktop-first HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was finished fast but it was quite challenging in terms of combining all the elements into one whole webpage. I had to experiment a lot with the CSS aspect, and I am confident that my HTML has a couple usless classes and ids, and that there is a far better solution to this project. Nevertheless the solution works as intended. JavaScript was also a challenging aspect of this project, I reasearched the Clock() function, and found awesome people who had verry good explanations(credits later). 

### Continued development

I don't plan on developing this project further, but I DO PLAN on improving my skills as a developer.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.scaler.com/topics/get-current-date-in-javascript/) - This is a great source if information regarding the Clock() function, I recommend everyone working on similar projects to give it a read.
- [Resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-validate-a-date-in-javascript/) - This is an amazing article which helped with validating input date.
- [Resource 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17732897/difference-between-two-dates-in-years-months-days-in-javascript) - This is an amazing discussion which helped with calculating the difference in Years Months and Days.
